# Notification for sensenet
Notification component for the [sensenet](https://github.com/SenseNet/sensenet) platform. Lets users subscribe to content changes and receive **emails** either almost immediately or in an aggregated way periodically about changes in the repository.

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SenseNet.Notification.Install.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SenseNet.Notification.Install)

You may install this component even if you only have the **sensenet Services** main component installed. That way you'll get the backend notification framework with a .Net API. 

> Currently there is no REST api for managing notifications, but you can create custom actions for that in your project - or better yet, contribute them to the official component!

If you also have the [sensenet WebPages](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-webpages) component installed (which gives you a UI framework built on *ASP.NET WebForms* for sensenet), you'll also get UI elements: notification actions and portlets with content views - a full user interface for subscribing to content events and an admin UI for managing notifications.

> To find out which packages you need to install, take a look at the available [sensenet components](http://community.sensenet.com/docs/sensenet-components).
